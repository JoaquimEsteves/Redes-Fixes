Notes: Get rid of them whenever

DNS: Translate names to IP and port number (gestor de nomes)
Default port: 80
Default email server: 25

Local Network for the proj, it SHOULD work elsewhere.
Socket: a door between application processes and the end-end-transport protocol (udp or TCP)
TCP service_ reliable transfer of bytes from one process to another.

socket: read file descriptor, write, typicall stuff.
  -> sockets are ints
  -> TCP garantees that bytes are delivered all nice and lovely (even if ya get interference or packet loss or whatever)
  -> UDP: No garantees, it does its best but kek
  
Server (running on hostid)                                                            Client
  create socket,
  port=x, for
  Incoming request:
  welcomeSocket = socket()
  |
  |
  |wait for incoming connection request
  connectionSocket= accept()      <------------TCP------------------------> clientSocket = socket(); connect()
  read write etc                                                                    u know the drill
  
  server stuff:
  first declare fd as a tcp socket.
  Clear memory,
  say the type of socket is AF_INET, declare any address for the server
  declare port number (constant or whatever)
  bind fd to server adress.
  start listenig
  
  warning: bind and fd = socket CAN return -1. Check 'em for errors.
  
  udp: no handshaking;
